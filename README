This is an update to a plugin I wrote a while ago.

It currently logs all requests made to your site, and I need to work on a display interface.

Useage:

In app_controller.php:

var $components = array('Loggable.Loggable');
var $helpers = array('Loggable.Loggable');

In views/layouts/default.ctp:

echo $this->Loggable->loggable();
